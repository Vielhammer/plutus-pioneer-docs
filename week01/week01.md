# Plutus Pioneer Program
## Lecture 1


Plutus is a functional development platform for distributed contract applications on the Cardano blockchain. It provides considerable security advantages by validating the contract off-chain before it moves on-chain. Plutus offers a new approach with both the on and off-chain code written in the same language.

Plutus programming is not easy. This course will be challenging for several reasons. First, Plutus uses the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) model. It is different and less intuitive than how Ethereum handles smart contracts.

Plutus is brand new and under rapid development. Throughout the course, there will probably be significant changes. You may write contracts at the beginning of the course that compile, which may not at the end. 

The tooling is not ideal yet. If you are familiar with Haskell and its tooling, you may find that it may not be as pleasant in the presence of Plutus. You may find it easier to use one or more of the following: Nix, Cabal, or Docker. The team is working on a Docker image that will be released later.

Plutus is embedded in Haskell and will be familiar if you are knowledgeable of Haskell. You will need to have a firm grasp of Haskell to understand Plutus. There is a [Haskell course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ3w5xyG4JWmBVIigNBytJhvSSfZZzfTm) that IOHK hosted in Mongolia in 2020 that is available. The content in the videos posted is specific to concepts required for writing Plutus.

Another problem is that Plutus is brand new. The IOHK team and Plutus Pioneers are the first people on the planet to write Plutus code. There is no Stack Overflow or searching Google for questions. 

The [Plutus Community Documentation](https://docs.plutus-community.com/) is an excellent resource for getting up and running. The [Discord server](https://discord.gg/) is a resource for asking questions and helping each other.
